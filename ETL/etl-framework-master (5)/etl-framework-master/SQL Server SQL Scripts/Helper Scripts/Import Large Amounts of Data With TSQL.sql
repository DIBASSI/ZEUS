--Split a batch up into chunks using a cursor.
--This method can be used for most any large table with some modifications
--It could also be refined further with an @Day variable (for example)
--This is for the case where you already have the data in a table
--and are ready to process it. Obviously, if you have a large flat file,
--you can just use BULK INSERT.
