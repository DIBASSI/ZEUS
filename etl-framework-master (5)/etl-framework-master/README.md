# Mass Street Analytics ETL Framework

This is a framework for moving data into a data warehouse. It includes everything you need to set up a self-service data platform.

This is the system that is used when Mass Street resources are tasked with implementing data warehouses. The framework has been developed over a period of six years. It is currently powering the analytics for several small to medium sized firms with anywhere from a few hundred GBs to several TBs of historical data.

There should be ZERO references to any specific system or database aside from Reporting and ODS. If you should find such a reference, please log an issue.

Postgres SQL Scripts are currently in active development. All you'll find there now is T-SQL being converted to PL/SQL.
